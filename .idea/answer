// open the class to inheritance to other class
//but the three value

open class shap() {
    val shapeName:""
    val shapeColor:Double
    val shapNum=6.0

    //add two fun and return only
    fun info(){
    return("&shapeColor ,&shapName")

    }
    // it will be used in other class
   open fun computeArea():Double {
   return shapNum

    }
}

fun main() {

}
// have alot of mistakes







## Part II - Practice with Class types. (optional)
---
### Open Questions:
- What is the difference between `enum classes` and `data classes`?
Enum its helps to make less mistake
data its like normal class but have ready fun =toString ,copy

- Which one of the `object` keyword ways can be used for the inheritance concept?
