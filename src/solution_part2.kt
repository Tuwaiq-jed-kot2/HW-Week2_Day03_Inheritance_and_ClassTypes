//## Part II - Practice with Class types. (optional)

// 1- What is the difference between `enum classes` and `data classes`?
//An enum is just like a class, having variables and functions.
//The only two differences is:
// 1- enum constants are public, static and final meaning "unchangeable"  and "cannot be overridden".
// 2- enum cannot be used to create objects, and it cannot extend other classes.

// 2- Which one of the `object` keyword ways can be used for the inheritance concept?
